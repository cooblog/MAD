</ul>
<p>I started the week by revisiting the MAD website shader that we had already edited with <strong>Nikolai</strong> last week. Again, I simulated incoming data by creating a few variables with random values and made them affect the RBG values of the background and foreground color:</p>
<pre><code>gl.uniform3f(uBackgroundColor, sentiment, 0.5705882352941176, 0.4549019607843137);
gl.uniform3f(uForegroundColor, 0.4764705882352941, polarity, 0.8117647058823529);)
</code></pre>
<p>Next we wanted to dive into a topic that allows for interesting chain reactions: buffers and FBOs. These are mostly familiar to me via openFrameworks. In my previous projects, I have for example switched between many FBOs with different textures based on Kinect and <a href="https://vimeo.com/414854407">webcam interaction</a>.</p>
<p>Buffer objects are a way of passing the data that shader programs need onto the GPU. (You can learn more by checking the articles by <a href="https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-how-it-works.html#:~:text=Buffers%20are%20the%20way%20of,vertex%20data%20onto%20the%20GPU.&amp;text=bufferData%20copies%20data%20into%20the,to%20the%20vertex%20shader&apos;s%20attributes.">WebGL Fundamentals</a> and by <a href="http://learnwebgl.brown37.net/rendering/buffer_object_primer.html">Learn WebGL</a>.) A frame buffer object (FBO), on the other hand, acts like an additional screen: one can draw yellow cubes onto one FBO, green spheres onto the other and then draw the contents of both FBOs onto the screen where one wants to.</p>
<p>We examined a beautiful <a href="https://github.com/kynd/reactive_buffers_experiment">example</a> by <strong>Kynd</strong> where reactive buffers interact with each other, resulting in watercolour-like patterns. We studied the code and edited the shader parameters to see which of them has the most visible effect on the final result.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-a-library">Choosing a library</h2>
<p>A bunch of interdependent 2D shaders can already get quite complex. What happens if a shader beginner wants to take them to 3D space? For my data viz project, I’m hoping to create a mental landscape where I could control the background and some other elements separately. One can imagine how amazing a 3D room would look like if its walls would be melting like in this lovely <a href="https://reverent-poincare-afe081.netlify.app/river/">shader project</a> by <strong>Ezra Miller</strong>.</p>
<p>Here, libraries come to help. Nikolai showed me some examples using <a href="https://github.com/oframe/ogl">OGL</a> that could be useful for this project. However, I decided to go with Three.js due to its large variety of examples. Editable materials like <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshStandardMaterial">MeshStandardMaterial</a> are also a bonus. For this project Three.js is a good choice, as it takes care of the less creative bits and lets the programmer focus on the shaders affecting the visuals and interaction with data.</p>
<p>By following <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_mirror_nodes.html">this</a> example, we created a simple 3D room from scratch and, instead of having a mirror, animated the back wall of the room based on a simple shader and a buffer:</p>
